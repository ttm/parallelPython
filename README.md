# Parallel python processing experiments

This repository is dedicated to scripts for parallel processing, both by multiple processes and by threads.

## Background

## Resources
- An introduction to parallel programming: http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_multiprocessing_intro.html
- Parallel Python Software: http://www.parallelpython.com/
- Python multiprocessing module: https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html
- Python threading module: https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html
- Joblib: https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/

## Further work
These experimental scripts are aimed at making computation faster for scientific goals, within Python framework. Therefore, another set of experiments should make explicit how to use and what are the benefits of Ctypes, Cython and other means to reach C from Python.
